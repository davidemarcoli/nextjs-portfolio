The File Finder is a plugin designed to help developers quickly find files in their project. The primary feature of this plugin is to locate associated files in your project structure. With a double-click of the mouse, you can easily navigate to an associated file.

The plugin uses an intelligent algorithm to extract the name of the current file you are working on and searches for other files based on that name. For instance, if you are working on a file named "UserController.java," the plugin will extract the name "User" and search for other files with that name.

The Project Files Finder plugin also comes with a customizable search location and search pattern feature that enables developers to customize their search to match their specific project requirements.
