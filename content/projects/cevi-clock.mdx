![Cevi Clock](/images/cevi-clock.png)

A unique digital clock that showcases the passage of time with an added twist. Built using React and TypeScript, this clock follows the usual time progression but makes a significant leap every day.


At its core, the Time Offset Clock functions as a regular digital clock, displaying the current hours, minutes, and seconds.
As the clock hits 21:00 (9 PM), instead of smoothly transitioning to the next hour, it leaps forward by three hours. This results in a sudden jump, taking the display time straight to 00:00.
The 3-hour offset accumulates each day. So, on the second day, when it reaches 21:00, the clock jumps to 03:00, on the third day to 06:00, and so on.
Designed to be distraction-free, the clock uses a full-screen interface, making it perfect for wall projections or as a standalone time display tool.

### Why this project?

This project was build for a cevi camp with a unique twist. The clock is used to display the time during the camp.
The activities are planned around the time jumps and the campers are encouraged to guess the time.
That means that they could be going to bed when the outside world is just waking up.
