Next Quiz is a quiz app built with Next.js.
It utilizes [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for the database.
For authentication, it uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) with the [Prisma Adapter](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/prisma) and the Google and GitHub providers.

It has the following features:
- Create quizzes
- Index cards
- Learn mode

The project is heavily inspired by [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) but it open source and self-hostable.
