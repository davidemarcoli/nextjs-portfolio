This is the website you're looking at. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It was my first time using next.js and I really enjoyed it. I'm not a huge fan of React, but next.js makes it a lot easier to work with.
It's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I got the initial project from [chronark](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com) and then I modified it to my needs.
Huge thanks to him for the initial design and the inspiration.
